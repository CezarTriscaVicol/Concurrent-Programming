Question 3:

Compile and run using:

  scalac UnboundedBuffer.scala
  scala UnboundedBuff
  
I feel like the implementation for this one is straight-forward enough.

Question 4:

Compile and run using:

  scalac Adaptive.scala AdaptiveTest.scala Trapezium.scala TrapeziumTest.scala
  scala AdaptiveTest
